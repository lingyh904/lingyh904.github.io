<strong>I am a doctoral candidate in developmental psychology at the Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania (expected May 2026), with dual master’s training in statistics and data science at the Wharton School.</strong>

From years of working with children, I have been inspired by how motivated they are to pursue goals—yet struck by how differently they respond when those goals become difficult. 

<strong>My research aims to better understand and support children’s successful goal pursuit under challenge, both in the short term and over development.</strong>

I address these questions by identifying motivational and self-regulatory mechanisms that support or hinder children’s goal pursuit across three levels:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Intrapersonal</strong> — how children’s intuitive theories about motivation guide self-regulatory decisions</li>
  <li><strong>Interpersonal</strong> — how caregivers’ beliefs about children and tasks shape parenting practices</li>
  <li><strong>Contextual</strong> — how socioeconomic and cultural contexts influence motivation and parenting</li>
</ul>

Across projects, I use experimental methods, quantitative modeling, qualitative analyses, and theoretical synthesis to study how motivation is regulated—and how it can be supported—in real-world learning environments. 

I collaborate closely with local museums and schools to preserve ecological validity, and I also conduct online studies using platforms such as Children Helping Science. 

My research follows open science practices, including preregistration and sharing de-identified data, materials, and code to support transparency and replication.

I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities in developmental psychology at the intersection of cognitive science, social psychology, and motivation research, starting around May 2026 or later.
