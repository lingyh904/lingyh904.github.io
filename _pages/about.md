I am a doctoral candidate in developmental psychology at the Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania (expected May 2026), with dual master’s training in statistics and data science at the Wharton School.

<strong>My research aims to better understand and support children’s successful goal pursuit under challenge, both in the short term and over development.</strong>

I address these questions by identifying motivational and self-regulatory mechanisms that support or hinder children’s goal pursuit across intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual levels. 

My work draws on psychological theories from cognitive, social, developmental psychology, and neuroscience. To balance causal inference with ecological validity, I use controlled experiments, quantitative modeling, and qualitative approaches, and collaborate with schools and museums to study motivation and self-regulation in real-world learning contexts.

I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities in developmental psychology at the intersection of cognitive science, social psychology, and motivation research, starting around May 2026 or later.
