Abstract: Philosophers and psychologists have long wrestled with why it can be so hard to achieve happiness. It seems simple enough: just pursue what we enjoy and avoid what we do not. Yet, the reality is far more complex. While we have simple preferences, we also set goals that often require sacrificing immediate pleasures for more meaningful rewards. Even children may frequently encounter conflicts between goals and preferences, such as choosing between watching cartoons and pursuing important learning goals. How do children perceive the role of goals in shaping our sense of happiness, beyond merely fulfilling our likes and dislikes? We conducted a series of studies to explore this question.

In Study 1, 4-5-year-old (N = 30) and 7-8-year-old (N = 30) children listened to stories about individuals whose simple preferences (like or dislike doing something) conflicted or aligned with more important goals. A linear mixed effects model revealed an interaction between Preference Valence (like or dislike) and Conflict Levels (Simple-Preference or Conflict) (F(1, 232) = 80.475, p < .001), Figure 1. Children attributed greater happiness to characters who performed a disliked activity (e.g., doing homework) to achieve an important goal (e.g., getting high testing scores), compared to similar actions that did not conflict with a goal (t(174) = 5.351, p < .001). Conversely, children attributed less happiness to characters who did something they liked (e.g., watching TV) at the expense of a goal (e.g., getting lower scores), compared to similar actions not conflicting with a goal (t(174) = -7.33, p < .001), Figure 1. This pattern was consistent across ages.

The findings of Study 1 raised the question of whether children’s attributions of happiness were also sensitive to conflicts between two simple preferences, not just conflicts between preference and important goals. Study 2 introduced a new condition where characters had to choose between two competing preferences. Conceptually replicating and extending results from Study 1, across age groups (N = 126), children attributed highest happiness to characters who fulfill simple preference (M = 3.64), lower happiness to characters fulfilling simple preference that conflicts with another preference (M = 2.98), and lowest happiness to those fulfilling simple preference that conflicts with goals (M = 2.15), Figure 2.

Moreover, Study 2 asked children to choose between a gift offering long-term benefits versus one providing immediate satisfaction. The less happiness a child attributed to the preference-goal conflict story, the more likely they were to choose a gift with long-term benefits, β = -0.08, p = .03.

Study 3 (ongoing, target N = 120) examines how children view different beliefs about happiness, such as happiness resulting from fulfilling preferences versus achieving goals. Children predict each character’s future decisions and achievements based on the character’s perspective on happiness and express their own preferences for each character and their corresponding beliefs.

Our studies suggest that children recognize that achieving important goals influences happiness beyond the satisfaction of immediate desires. This recognition also predicted children’s own choice between long-term benefits over immediate satisfaction. These findings illuminate the nature of happiness in the eyes of children, with significant implications for promoting their motivation and achievement.
