title: "Portfolio item number 2"
excerpt: "Parenting is the immediate context in which development unfolds, shaping children’s beliefs through everyday practices, communication, and the opportunities parents create. Parallel to my work on children, a second line of my research examines how parents’ beliefs about goals, identity, and learning shape caregiving behavior. Drawing on identity-based motivation theory and the possible selves framework, I study how parents construct representations of their children’s future identities and how these representations guide present-day parenting practices."
