title: "Children’s Intuitive Theories of Motivation"
excerpt: "What do children believe motivation is, and how do those beliefs shape self-regulation and learning?"

My dissertation examines how children make sense of motivation and use that understanding to predict effort, persistence, and learning. Across studies, I test children’s intuitive theories about what motivation is, where it comes from, and how it can be shaped—especially by goals, thoughts, and task contexts.

In this line of work, I ask:

- Do children value goal commitment, and do they use commitment cues to predict persistence and success?
- Do children recognize that thoughts and cognitive strategies (e.g., reframing) can change motivation and self-regulation?
- Do children represent qualitatively different types of motivation (e.g., intrinsic, identified, external), and reason flexibly about when each is effective across task contexts?
