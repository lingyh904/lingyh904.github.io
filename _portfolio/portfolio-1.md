title: "Children’s Intuitive Theories of Motivation"
excerpt: "Human beings are not only motivated to pursue goals; they are also motivated to monitor and manage their engagement with those goals, especially in the face of challenges. How people monitor and manage their motivation is shaped, in part, by how they understand motivation—what motivation is, whether it is malleable and controllable, and which strategies are effective for regulating it.

In this line of research, I study the development of children’s intuitive theories of motivation: how children conceptualize motivation, how they use these beliefs to predict and evaluate others’ effort, persistence, and success, and how these beliefs and reasoning processes shape their own motivation and self-regulation."
